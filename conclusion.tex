\section{Conclusion}

Side channel attacks don't divulge everything overnight; instead they ease the calculations and assumptions that helps rest of the operations accomplished in bounded time. Although the existing AES encryption model has sufficient complexity to blow away any straightforward attempt to break the security, side-channels still poses a real threat and a bad implementation of the cipher might lead to dire consequences.\\

The most challenging part of security is now making the implementation of the existing ciphers resistant to side-channel attacks. Preventing leakage of information through side-channel is not a trivial task at all. The experiment has shown that even the straightforward Table lookup approach can be made secure without the assistance of any piece of special software or hardware. And that might be the most important requirement in the industry.
